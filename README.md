# Data-Analysis-With-R

Just 2 small scripts that serve the basics of data analysis in R (with some default values for the vectors). I did this as preparation and support for my online exam. They may also help you to get started with R and learning to understand the fundamentals of data analysis. Instead of using the built-in R-Functions the calculation paths are output more precisely on the console, in order to make the calculation process more understandable.

The scripts contain the following topics:
- regression analysis
    - simple
    - mulitple
- Forecast intervals
- Confidence intervals
- One-sample-tests
    - one-sample expectation tests
    - one-sample proportional value tests
    - one-sample variance tests
- Two-sample-tests
    - welch-test
    - t-test
    - gaussian-test (normal distribution with known variances)
    - approximated gaussian-test (normal distribution with unknown variances)
    - wilcoxon test
- Distribution tets
    - kolmogorov-smirnov Test
    - chi-squared independence test
    - chi-suqared goodnes-of-fit test
